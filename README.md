# Python Basics 


This repository is the prepartion that I have completed with a view to reading for a PhD or MSc. My aim is to be fully proficient in Python with heavy slant towards M.L. and geophysics. Most of the files here exercises from Codewars as well as other learning materials and notes. 

The seismic folder is where I aim build and complete projects focused on subsurface imaging and signal processing in the near future. My aim is to use a mixture of Python libraries including SEGYIO SEGSAK and Bruges as well as PyTorch and Deepwave.  

The first project that I aiming to build is a recreation of this paper - https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-vi-gpu-computing/chapter-38-imaging-earths-subsurface-using-cuda . The idea will be to port the C into Python.

Please note - this repository is a refreshed version, when I deleted the the previous version and I lost my contribution history.
